Achtneil used to be run over by bandits. Vargon gathered the troops and took it back.

Gretchen is a Owlen.

Tower near Achtneil where there is an old library. It is a mages study full of knowledge and a healing scroll. There is Lady of Script and Shadow that looks over the place. Maybe we can find something for David and Kricket there.
