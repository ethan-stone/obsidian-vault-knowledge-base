Aunt of someone in Farrowilt. Parents are gone. They only left with a cryptic note about basking in the sunlight. Very ominous.

He was somehow affected by the [[Arisen One]]. He has spurts of bloodlust.

Our working theory is that it is something similar to before the Dragonic wars, where gods would inhabit champions to fight. However whatever is potentially taking over Daniel is much worse.
