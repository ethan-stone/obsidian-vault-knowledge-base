Was directed to Millstone Farms by Meredith of the War Talons. They were hired to retrieve the Keystone for [[Pip Bridgerson]] and deliver it there. 

While there were introduced to [[Regis]] the headmaster. He brought us to the living room. We then snuck around and eventually came across a room where we found [[Bertrem Munchquick]], [[Philanor]], and [[Regis]], on one side of room talking to 3 shadowy hooded figures. The hooded figures were extremely upset with Bertrem and Philanor for the failure in Farrowilt to create the [[Arisen One]]. After the conversation, the hooded figures disappeared leaving the hoods on the ground.

We then interrogated Bertrem and found out about his wrong doings, as well as a map with 4 locations marked. An area over the [[Dwarven Kingdom]], [[Farrowilt]], [[Moonglow Keep]], and [[Kitan Canyon]].

We then snuck into Regis' room and found a burglar tied up with bite marks. Turns out Regis is a Ghast and can turn people into Ghouls. Regis then entered the room and we fought.
