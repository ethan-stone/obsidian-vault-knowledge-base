Member of the [[Order of the Golden Eclipse]]. Very suspicious according to [[Bertrem Munchquick]], before his head blew up. She is somehow associated with the [[Three Hooded Shadowy Figures]]. Not sure if it is just her or if it is the entire [[Order of the Golden Eclipse]]. It is unclear if they are working together, or maybe just happen to have the same goal and are reluctantly cooperating. Maybe the [[Order of the Golden Eclipse]] is evil. Or maybe it is good, and Philanor is a double agent?
