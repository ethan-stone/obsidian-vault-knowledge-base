A sophisticated gang that is more for hire than an independently moving organization. Whenever companies want to steal from, spy on, or sabotage another company they go to The Velvet Hand. The only thing they care about is who is the highest bidder. As a consequence, they know some of the deepest and darkest secrets of some of most powerful and wealthy people in the city.

They are not beyond killing as a means to an end, but they try to avoid it as much as possible.

Some of the primary ways they make money are.
- Getting hired to steal information from other businesses, or spy on them.
- Getting hired to sabotage other business.
- Getting hired to destroy information and evidence of illegal activities of business obtained by [[The Sentinels]].
- All this meddling causes major fluctuations in the stock market, meaning they can carefully invest and benefit from it. For example if the sabotage a business, the value of a competitor will likely go up so they can invest in that.
