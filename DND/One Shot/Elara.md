## Backstory

Elara grew up as an orphan on the streets, learning to survive by her wits and agility. She developed her skills in stealth and deception to avoid trouble and steal food. She was taken in briefly by a thieves' guild, where she honed her skills further, but she left when she realized their methods were too cruel. She now uses her skills to help those in need, often working as a vigilante, righting wrongs from the shadows. She is haunted by the things she had to do to survive as a child and seeks to atone for them by helping others. She is terrified of being caught or exposed, fearing that her past will catch up with her.
