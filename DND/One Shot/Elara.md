## Backstory

Elian grew up as an orphan on the streets, learning to survive by his wits and agility. He developed his skills in stealth and deception to avoid trouble and steal food. He was taken in briefly by a thieves' guild, where he honed his skills further, but he left when he realized their methods were too cruel. He now uses his skills to help those in need, often working as a vigilante, righting wrongs from the shadows. He is haunted by the things he had to do to survive as a child and seeks to atone for them by helping others. He is terrified of being caught or exposed, fearing that his past will catch up with him.

*   **Quirks:** Carries a tarnished silver locket with a picture of a dried flower, a memento from his childhood. He often nervously polishes the locket when stressed. He also has a habit of apologizing excessively, even when he's done nothing wrong.
