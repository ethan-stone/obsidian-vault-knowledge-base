## Class Features

*   **Level 1: Rage:**
    *   In battle, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
    *   While raging, you gain the following benefits:
        *   Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
        *   When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
        *   You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
    *   If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
    *   Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage as a bonus action.
*   **Level 1: Unarmored Defense:** While you are not wearing any armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
*   **Level 2: Reckless Attack:** When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
*   **Level 2: Danger Sense:** You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
*   **Level 3: Path of the Totem Warrior (Bear Totem):** While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage.
*   **Level 5: Extra Attack:** You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
*   **Level 5: Fast Movement:** Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.
*   **Level 6: Totem Warrior Feature (Bear Totem):** The damage reduction applies to all allies within 10 feet of you.
*   **Level 7: Feral Instincts:** You can give yourself advantage on initiative rolls.
*   **Level 9: Brutal Critical (1 die):** You can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
*   **Level 10: Totem Warrior Feature (Spirit Walker):** Can cast the spell commune with nature.
*   **Level 11: Relentless Rage:** If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.

## Background: Hermit
