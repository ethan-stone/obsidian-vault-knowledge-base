# Origins
Born into modest means in the [[Deephaven (Aka The Nether)]]. Not necessarily born into poverty, and lived in one of the safer areas, but family was living paycheck to paycheck, parents worked very long hours, and because of this didn't have many time for friends growing up. As soon as he was old enough he got a job in the factories in [[The Dust Bowl]]. For a while he worked there. Eventually he met his wife [[Isabella Thorne]] who was a record keeper at the factory.
# Gaining Wealth
When his daughter, Ella, was born, Alexi's world changed. He vowed to provide her with opportunities he never had, but when she fell seriously ill, his priorities shifted towards finding a cure. Facing mounting medical bills, Alexi borrowed money, investing it wisely in burgeoning businesses and leveraging his natural charm and business acumen to forge beneficial partnerships. His ventures flourished, and he quickly ascended [[Etheria]]'s social and economic ladder.
# The Birth of The Velvet Hand
To fund his daughter's treatments and research into her condition, Alexi realized he needed not just wealth, but power and influence that extended beyond the reach of the law. Thus, The Velvet Hand was bornâ€”not out of a desire for criminal empire, but as a means to an end. Alexi used his organization to generate the enormous sums needed for Ella's care, engaging in white-collar crime, manipulation, and the shadow economy. His actions, though illegal, were fueled by a singular, unwavering love for his daughter.
# Alexi Thorne, the Philanthropist
To the public, Alexi Thorne is a generous philanthropist, a self-made business magnate who never forgot his roots. He is well-liked and respected, known for his charitable contributions and efforts to improve [[Etheria]]. He maintains this facade to protect his daughter and his true motives, ensuring that The Velvet Hand's activities remain in the shadows.
