In the Rumpus Room. 
# First Vision
Said something about a black cat with a red flag and the wind is blowing but the flag does not move. Also mentioned a door with a crescent moon that is always locked but has no key and that is the room I'm looking for.
# Second Vision
Sees the house being run down. Sees eight red envelopes on eight pedestals. In each envelope is a letter written by a different person. Says I will only find seven. Much like art hanging on the wall of the rooms, there is a letter missing.
# Third Vision
Sees a vision of a guy (not Simon) in the halls (specifically the photo red room). He wears a fedora. He's taking items and watching me. There is also a vision of a room a statue of essentially the grim reaper.
# Fourth Vision
Hears children in the forest. Hears children laughing in the courtyard. Sees an old man in an older chair. Here sees a bunch of old people that sat in the same chair with many stories.
# Fifth Vision
Sees a statue in a misty courtyard with a statue. Same statue of the general blessing. Sees me walking on the paths wondering and waiting for a shadow that will never be cast. Honestly seems similar to the sigil solution.
# Sixth (Final) Vision
Vision of a train station, a cave with the 8 or infinity symbol, a bridge with a cottage, a cavern wall of stone, a hollow lit by a sea of a thousand burning stars, a treasure buried beneath the cliff rock (blue flame elevator), a black mirror in the mirror is a figure of myself. Mirror is in the shape of Oris.
