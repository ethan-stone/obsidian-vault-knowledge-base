In the Rumpus Room. 
# First Vision
Said something about a black cat with a red flag and the wind is blowing but the flag does not move. Also mentioned a door with a crescent moon that is always locked but has no key and that is the room I'm looking for.
# Second Vision
Sees the house being run down. Sees eight red envelopes on eight pedestals. In each envelope is a letter written by a different person.
