The pedestal in the ante chamber says "So close, yet so far away".

The North Door reveals the shrine with a note in it saying.

"
Steady is the scepter
Deadly is the stone
Heavy is the crown
Ready is the throne
"

Need to get the scepter, cursed effigy, and crown in a single run and get to the throne room, just like in the picture in one of the class rooms.
