IN ARIES COURT WHERE THE KING NOW LAYS
ON THE SACRED HOUR THAT TIMEWORN PHRASE
WILL A YOUTH APPROACH WITH EMPTY ARMS
WITHOUT GIFTS NOR GOLD NOR MANNERED CHARMS
AND IN SKY ABOVE A BRILLIANT SIGN
A SULLEN CROSS AS FIVE STARS ALIGN
A PATIENT FIGURE A RECKONING GREAT
THE BLACK KEY IS LYING WITH THE LAST KING OF EIGHT

Sacred hour = 1:30 I think
A youth approach with empty arms without gifts nor gold nor mannered charms = go down to the area without any items or gold or gems or anything
