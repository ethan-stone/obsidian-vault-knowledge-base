# Room 1
Contains a box puzzle that is called The Orinda Aries Variation. Says when BLACK TILES are pressed the entire row shifts to the right, as if on train rails.

The chamber has a sigil that matches that in the other room. Lines up because the sigil describes the country as metropolitan, foggy, and uses trains as transportation.

There is also a letter from Herbert to the estate about him setting out on a journey across 8 realms in 8 months. Says he did so without a map, but headed south to "a fragment of the old kingdom, a landmark as black as it is in name, and a story I feel closely connected to".

Other things on the letter of note. There is a stamp with Fenn Aries with the numbers 1412112L. The address of the estate is Reddington Fenn Aries 63080.

Next the letter is stone art of the statue that has the crown and the mace/scepter, and three small statues people in crowns holding out bowls. Two men and one woman.
- Update: The three people are the three children of the fourth king of Orindia who split the land into three parts, one for each kid.

There is also a painting above the letter of some train tracks, maybe even a train station. There is a sign that says Reddington. There is a statue of an angel with a top hot.

So in conclusion the first place Herbert when was Orinda Aries. That is part of the solution to the puzzle in room 46.

# Room 3
This is the room of Arch Aries. See [[History of Orindia]].

Letter from Herbert saying he arrived to Renebaum, Arch Aries after a few days of sailing and it made him realize how much more convenient it would have been in the old days when the railway tracks extended all the way north. Arch Aries is a destination with which I am well acquainted, having traveled here countless time on business for Synka,. This time however, I will avoid the familiar towns and factories and will instead trek along the northern coast, an area with which he is wholly unfamiliar.
