# Room 1
Contains a box puzzle that is called The Orinda Aries Variation. Says when BLACK TILES are pressed the entire row shifts to the right, as if on train rails.

The chamber has a sigil that matches that in the other room. Lines up because the sigil describes the country as metropolitan, foggy, and uses trains as transportation.

There is also a letter from Herbert to the estate about him setting out on a journey across 8 realms in 8 months. Says he did so without a map, but headed south to "a fragment of the old kingdom, a landmark as black as it is in name, and a story I feel closely connected to".

Other things on the letter of note. There is a stamp with Fenn Aries with the numbers 1412112L. The address of the estate is Reddington Fenn Aries 63080.

Next the letter is stone art of the statue that has the crown and the mace/scepter, and three small statues people in crowns holding out bowls. Two men and one woman.
- Update: The three people are the three children of the fourth king of Orindia who split the land into three parts, one for each kid.

There is also a painting above the letter of some train tracks, maybe even a train station. There is a sign that says Reddington. There is a statue of an angel with a top hot.

So in conclusion the first place Herbert when was Orinda Aries. That is part of the solution to the puzzle in room 46.
# Room 2
This is the room of Fenn Aries.

Letter from Herbert.

"I am actually writing this LAST postcard sitting at my desk at home. I suppose I should put forth the extra effort and drop it in the mail for consistency, but I am tempted to save the postmaster a trip as it will just wind up here once again to join the other seven, which I am please to report were all waiting for me on my desk safe as can be. Flipping through them has reminded me of the many friends I made and lessons learned along the way, and as I look back one truth shines brighter than the others:

Air travel is much better than sea travel.

Herbert

P.S. Remind Anne to replace the books I lost.

# Room 3
This is the room of Arch Aries. See [[History of Orindia]].

Letter from Herbert saying he arrived to Renebaum, Arch Aries after a few days of sailing and it made him realize how much more convenient it would have been in the old days when the railway tracks extended all the way north. Arch Aries is a destination with which I am well acquainted, having traveled here countless time on business for Synka,. This time however, I will avoid the familiar towns and factories and will instead trek along the northern coast, an area with which he is wholly unfamiliar.

# Room 4
Room for Eraja.

Letter from Herbert.

"I was a little disappointed that there has not been a drop of rain during my time here as every Erajan story I have ever heard has begun with rain. I suppose the anecdotes I make on this trip will have to do without that flavorful setting. However, even without the rain, the puddles and ponds that dot the countryside make this place feel different than home.

Lorja Yenna, Ajlor Lune,

Herbert

# Room 5
Room for Corarica

Letter from Herbert.

"
There have been fewer and fewer opportunities, the further we travel up into the mountains, to attend my correspondence and I find myself regretting having brought so many books, as this is the first realm I have visited without porters. Here, every person is expected to carry their own belongings, and if you can't, you throw away "that which is expendable". It's looking like I'll be bringing back less souvenirs than I had planned. I never expected to appreciate the cold, but the frigid weather here is a welcome relief coming from the sweltering shores of Verra.

P.S.

I ended up forsaking all but one of my books
"

Confirms Herbert visited Corarica AFTER Verra.

# Room 6
Room for Mora Jai

Letter from Herbert.

"
After a short sea voyage, we arrived on the main island of Mora Jai last night in good spirits. The people here are belligerent in their politeness and after spending a full day among the Jaioreil I am just as afraid of eating another dish as I am of rejecting their offers. I may try to sneak away tomorrow and spend some time alone with my books as I have noticed that each realm I have visited has on thing in common. They each have been short of solitude.
"

# Room 7
Room for Verra.

Letter from Herbert.

"
Despite my prejudice against Mother Nature, I own that I have deeploy loved my time here at Verra. The memories of the youthful trip I took here with my brother have been relentless, and as I have gotten older, I find less and less occasion to recollect on such trivial pleasures. One thing I do remember vividly which has not lost a single speck of charm are the famous turtles. Each visitor of Verra, upon arriving, is lent one of these hard shell friends for the duration of their stay to serve as both steed, guide and companion. I am still under the spell of island life, even if the weather here is much more sever than it was on Mora Jai.
"

Confirmed Herbert went to Mora Jai before Verra.
