- So far both letters were found next to a Ruby. Probably from the Ruby Crown that's been referenced in a few places.
# Number 4
By Daniel. Daniel is angry at Herbert for omitting the details of Marion's "disappearance" from the public record. Interesting that disappearance is in quotes. Marion sacrificed a lot for a good cause. He thinks all countrymen should be aware of the "the price she paid and must be made to see the color of the flag she flew as she road into the darkness of a hundred nights". Confirmed Marion is Simon's mother and Daniel is maybe Herberts brother, making Daniel Simon's grandfather.

# Number 7
By Courtney. Seems to Simon's Aunt. Also Angry at Herbert for being so indifferent about the disappearance of Mary (Simon's Mom), the same person Daniel is talking about. Courtney has reason to believe Herbert helped smuggle Mary across the red border to the southern seafront. Believes it occurred in September a full 7 months after she was reported missing. This date coincides with the theft of the Ruby Crown, not the day of her public "disappearance". Believes Mary is alive because 2 of the 8 rubies on the crown have resurfaced. Says Marion is finally free. What did she do.
