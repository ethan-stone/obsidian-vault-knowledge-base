- So far both letters were found next to a Ruby. Probably from the Ruby Crown that's been referenced in a few places.
# Number 4
By Daniel. Daniel is angry at Herbert for omitting the details of Marion's "disappearance" from the public record. Interesting that disappearance is in quotes. Marion sacrificed a lot for a good cause. He thinks all countrymen should be aware of the "the price she paid and must be made to see the color of the flag she flew as she road into the darkness of a hundred nights". Confirmed Marion is Simon's mother and Daniel is maybe Herberts brother, making Daniel Simon's grandfather.

# Number 7
By Courtney. Seems to Simon's Aunt. Also Angry at Herbert for being so indifferent about the disappearance of Mary (Simon's Mom), the same person Daniel is talking about. Courtney has reason to believe Herbert helped smuggle Mary across the red border to the southern seafront. Believes it occurred in September a full 7 months after she was reported missing. This date coincides with the theft of the Ruby Crown, not the day of her public "disappearance". Believes Mary is alive because 2 of the 8 rubies on the crown have resurfaced. Says Marion is finally free. What did she do.

# Number 8 (The eight is sidways)
Letter from the people that stole the red letters and Herbert had to pay. They apparently made a "threat" to Herbert that was intentionally vague and misleading. They say they are actually sympathetic for why the letters exist in the first place.
The letter is just signed X.

# Number 6 (6 is spelled out like six)
This one is written to Mary from Herbert. He "principal desire" has been Simon even through hardship. He says that he will do everything he can to shield Simon from any fallout of Mary's current project, whatever that is. He says she should be reunited with Simon again before his 10th birthday and that it'll be 2 years since she left. This means letter is from 4 years ago. He says the meeting they had was probably their last, and that he is too stubborn to leave the home and has become too attached. Says he has a premonition he will be buried in red soil under red flags, and that Mary would not accept that. He says Mary is following in her father's footsteps (so Herbert's brother or brother in law) and making the same sacrifices he did.

# Number 5
This one is written by Mary to Herbert. It's about her leaving on a trolly to the southern border. Again she says she is following in her father's footsteps. She says we, so she is traveling with at least one other person. She left a message for Simon in the Safehouse. She says if something should happen to her, Herbert should guide Simon to that place and should teach me the intersection between foolishness and doctirine.

# Number 1
This one is written by Mr Worth Laude. His father worked for Herbert's father (Thomas Sinclair) between 1915 and 1918. He seemed to be a miner, and took a bunch of the Sinclair family secrets to his grave. But he heard a bunch of stories during conversations. He doesn't believe the stories, but wants to share them.

# Number 2
Addressed to just M (Mary?) from Caleb. Talks about being plans be set for a month or two from now. Talks about a "flexible" floorplan for a trial run, and that Herbert actually agreed. Seems to be about the robbery at the museum. They secured a redprint of the museum's "Closed Exhibit". The closing regards is "Until we meet on the shore of the white sands". Probably talking about the country south of Orinda/Fenn Aries.
