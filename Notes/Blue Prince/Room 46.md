There is a message of where to find the sanctum keys.

The first key found here on the furthest rank, (Found)
The second locked tight in the vault of a bank,
The third is high up, among all the clocks, (Found)
And the fourth down below, beneath all the docks.
The fifth key is held by a king on his throne,
The sixth in a station, left by one of your own (Found),
The seventh is major if you draft it quite late,
And the last key is waiting, behind the last door of eight.

There is a puzzle of a map saying "8 realms in 8 months". Have to put pins on the map in the right order.
- First place is Orinda Aries. Not sure what land area on the map that is though. Associated with trains.

There are 4 busts. One for each family. Sinclair, Epsen, Marigold, and Jones.

There is a note in the desk that how someone has the letters and they will return the 8 letters with 8 payments of 100 gold. Instructions to follow.
