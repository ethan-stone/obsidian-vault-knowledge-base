# Number 8
"message" is bolded
Stones cut by hand and letters wrought
Do spell our secrets carved from though
A message read is often lost
Among the bold words spoken soft
The note is read the letter is not

# Number 5
"sheets" is bold
Tree found inside will never shade
The gems that shine in night and rain
The clue you hold can not be paid
With gems nor coin so toss away
These sheets you find a worthy trade

"sheets" is in bold letters.
