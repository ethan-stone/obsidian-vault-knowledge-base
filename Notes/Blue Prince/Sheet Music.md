# Number 8
"message" is bolded
Stones cut by hand and letters wrought
Do spell our secrets carved from though
A message read is often lost
Among the bold words spoken soft
The note is read the letter is not

# Number 5
"sheets" is bold
Tree found inside will never shade
The gems that shine in night and rain
The clue you hold can not be paid
With gems nor coin so toss away
These sheets you find a worthy trade

# Number 6
"are" is bold
Under these stars the dance is held
And to the floor we are compelled
The gowns glide on and music swells
And at the end the clock strikes twelve
What that means only time can tell

# Number 7
