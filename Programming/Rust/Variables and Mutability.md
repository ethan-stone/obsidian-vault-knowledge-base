# Overview
- Variables are immutable by default.
- Variables can become mutable by using the `mut` keyword.
- Constants, defined using `const` instead of `let` can never be changed.
- Shadowing means redefining a variable using `let`. It allows some mutations to the variable, and once those mutations are done it is immutable.
