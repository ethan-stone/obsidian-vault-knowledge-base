# Scalar Types
- These represent a single value.
- There are four primary scalar types.
	- Integers
	- Floating-point numbers
	- Booleans
	- Characters
## Integers
- There are signed and unsigned integers.
- Signed integers means it can be positive or negatives.
- Unsigned integers means it is always positive.
- `u32` means an unsigned integer type with 32 bits. So this is any integer between 0 and `2^32 - 1`.
- `i32` means a signed integer type with 32 bits. So this is any integer between `-2^32` to `2^31 - 1`.
